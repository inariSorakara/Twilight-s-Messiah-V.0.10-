#Twilight's Messiah V 0.10 TODO list.

#Specific things to develope:
	#Turn system:
		#Start turn Method
		#End turn Method
	#Doom clock system
	#Moving system overhaul
	#Fade out animation.

#Primary things:
	#Continue with both the player's and Nya's state machines.
	#When the player goes from Choosing room to Inmenu, reset the player's rotation to the state it was before entering.
	#Implement on the player script the current room variable and target room variable.
	#Make it so, when the player's body enters a room, the room area has a reference of the room itself become
	the player's current room.
	#While choosing room, find a way to make the room the player is looking towards the "target room" variable (Very probably will be done with a raycast 3D)
	#If there's no room, point that out in the Nya's notification.
	#Have nya indicate the target room or if there's no room there.
	#After the player chooses a room:
		#If there's no room there, have Nya inform so.
		#If there's a target room:
			#Create a method to move from room to room:
				#Fade the screen to black
				#Move the player to the target room, making it in the process the current room
				#Fade the screen back.
				#Create a "Turn end method" and have it run after moving the player FOR NOW (It will later happen after the event happens)
#Secondary things:
	#Make the torches actually emit light
