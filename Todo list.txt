#Twilight's Messiah V 0.10 TODO list.

#Specific things to develope:
	#Turn system:
		#Start turn Method
		#End turn Method
	#Doom clock system
	#Moving system overhaul
	#Fade out animation.

#Primary things:
	#Continue with both the player's and Nya's state machines.
	#Create a new state for both state machines. Something akin to "MovementConfirming" or something like that
	#Suggest the player to press either confirm or negate.
	#If they negate go back to choosing, if they confirm, enter the (new state)"Moving" state for both state machines 
	#After the player chooses a room:
		#If there's no room there, have Nya inform so.
		#If there's a target room:
			#Create a method to move from room to room:
				#Fade the screen to black
				#Move the player to the target room, making it in the process the current room
				#Fade the screen back.
				#Create a "Turn end method" and have it run after moving the player FOR NOW (It will later happen after the event happens)
#Secondary things:
	#Make the torches actually emit light
	#Have it so the walls that lead nowhere don't have doors.
	#Make it so the player rotates back into the initial y.degrees instead of jumping to it.
