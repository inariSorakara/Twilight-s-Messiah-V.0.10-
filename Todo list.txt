#Twilight's Messiah V 0.10 TODO list.

#Continue with the player state machine
# Make up a function to move from one room to the other
#Make the torches actually emit light
# Nya will replace the "Player notification" system and he will always be floating infront of the player.
# Create a state machine for Nya that will change accordingly to the players
# Create methods on Nya's states to display text on entering, update and exit
# Make it so on some states the text presented is randomly chosen.
The text on the Idle state should read something akin to "We are on room [The value in the room's coordinate variable that should modify the player's "current room@ variable.]"
