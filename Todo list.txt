#Continue with the player state machine
# Make up a function to move from one room to the other
# Make every mesh on the same scene, and then make the appropiate version of each room visible of invisible.
#Make the torches actually emit light
# Nya will replace the "Player notification" system and he will always be floating infront of the player.
